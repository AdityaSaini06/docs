# Welcome to Next.js!

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to Next.js, a powerful React framework for building full-fledged web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js sits on top of React, providing additional features and optimizations specifically designed for building web applications. It leverages React components for crafting user interfaces, while Next.js itself handles other aspects like routing, data fetching, and performance enhancements.

Under the hood, Next.js takes care of essential tooling configurations required for React development, including bundling, compiling, and more. This frees you from manual configuration, allowing you to focus on the core logic of your application.

Next.js caters to both individual developers and larger teams, empowering them to create interactive, dynamic, and high-performance React applications.

## Main Features

Next.js offers a rich set of features that streamline the development process. Here's a glimpse into some of the key highlights:

* **Routing:** Next.js boasts a file-system based router built upon Server Components. This robust router supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more.
* **Rendering:** Next.js provides flexibility in rendering options. You can choose between client-side and server-side rendering with Client and Server Components. It further optimizes rendering with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server, alongside Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes.
* **Data Fetching:** Data fetching is simplified with async/await functionality within Server Components. Additionally, Next.js offers an enhanced `fetch` API that empowers you with request memoization, data caching, and revalidation capabilities.
* **Styling:** Next.js integrates seamlessly with your preferred styling methods. You can leverage CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, or even CSS-in-JS solutions for styling your application.
* **Optimizations:** Next.js incorporates optimizations for images, fonts, and scripts, leading to improved Core Web Vitals and a superior user experience.
* **TypeScript Support:** Next.js offers exceptional support for TypeScript, providing enhanced type checking and efficient compilation. You can even leverage custom TypeScript plugins and type checkers for extended control.

## How to Use These Docs

The navigation bar on the left side of the screen serves as your guide through the documentation. The doc pages are structured sequentially, progressing from fundamental concepts to more advanced topics. This allows you to follow a step-by-step approach while building your application. However, feel free to explore the documentation at your own pace, jumping to specific sections that align with your needs.

The right side of the screen displays a table of contents, offering a convenient way to navigate between sections within a particular page. If you need to locate a specific page quickly, utilize the search bar at the top or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To embark on your Next.js journey, we recommend starting with the **Installation** guide.

## App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js provides two distinct routers: App Router and Pages Router.

* **App Router:** This is the newer router, designed to leverage React's latest features like Server Components and Streaming.
* **Pages Router:** The original Next.js router, it empowers you to build server-rendered React applications and remains supported for legacy Next.js applications.

A dropdown menu at the top of the sidebar allows you to switch between the documentation for App Router and Pages Router features. It's crucial to keep track of the selected tab, as certain features are exclusive to each respective router.

The page breadcrumbs at the top will also indicate whether you're viewing App Router or Pages Router documentation.

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge

While we strive to make our documentation approachable for beginners, a baseline understanding of specific concepts is recommended to ensure a focused learning experience. We'll provide links to relevant documentation whenever a new concept is introduced.

To fully grasp the potential of our documentation, it's beneficial to have a foundational understanding of HTML, CSS, and React. If you require a refresher on React fundamentals, check out our React Foundations Course. Subsequently, delve deeper into Next.js by building a dashboard application.

## Accessibility

For optimal accessibility while navigating the documentation using a screen reader, we recommend using Firefox with NVDA or Safari with VoiceOver.
