## Introduction

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables server-side rendering, static site generation, and more. This guide will walk you through the setup, configuration, routing, API routes, styling, and deployment of a Next.js application.

## Setup

### Create a New Project

First, create a new Next.js project using the create-next-app command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app my-next-app
```

# Configuration

## next.config.js

Next.js can be customized using the `next.config.js` file in the root of your project.

### Example Configuration

```js
module.exports = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  images: {
    domains: ['example.com'],
  },
};
